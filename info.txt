## The Challenge

In this repo we have provided the skeleton of an app along with some prebuilt screens. You will have to build some extra functionalities on top of them, integrate an HTTP API and add tests. We have included some screenshots to help you implement the missing screens.

The API you're gonna use is [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). It's free to use but you'll need to create a new account and request an API key. You should find all the instructions to get an API key in the linked docs. Please reach out if you encounter any issues getting an API key or using the API.

## Requirements

For a full list of requirements, please refer to the [REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md) file in this repo

## Delivery

To deliver the challenge, please create a PR against the `main` branch on this repo.

We expect candidates to take 4 - 6 hours to complete this challenge. Please take your time and make sure to review your code for bugs, performance issues but above all, have fun!

Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions. Just try to do it as early as possible to avoid any blockages.

**One last thing**, please add tests. We are really interested in seeing how you write and structure tests.
